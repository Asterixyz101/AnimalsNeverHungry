# AnimalsNeverHungry
A Stardew Valley Mod to remove the animal hunger system from the game.

Uses Content Patcher to change GrassEatAmount from 2 to 0, functionally removing the animal hunger system from the game.
Made for a Randomizer Context, where aquiring the Silo and the Auto-Feed Upgrades to the Barn/Coop are up to chance and
sleeping through multiple days is encouraged.

Requires ContentPatcher greater or equal to 2.7.0
